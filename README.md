# HTML5 Boilerplate - High Test
> [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com) has a ready to install task
manager and Bourbon, Bitters, and Neat at your disposal.  

### Task manager
> Manages most tasks like auto refresh, minify and source mapping.  

1. Your machine must have Node.js and NPM installed to use the task manager.  It is also assumed that you have WAMP
or similar installed.  
2. Ensure the ***HTML-Boilerplate*** folder and all of its contents are copied into the ***www*** folder within the WAMP directory.   
Find instructions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm?utm_source=house&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=free%20orgs&utm_term=Install%20npm).  
3. To install the package.json and its dependencies, type `npm install`.  It will take a few minutes to install.  
4. To run the task manager: While in the root directory, type 'gulp'.  
  - If your browser displays a **"Not Found"** error, open ***gulpfile.js*** and ensure the path on `line 55` points to ***HTML-Boilerplate*** on your machine.
5. To exit the gulp task manager, press **CTRL-C** twice.
