Use main.css if you are NOT using the SCSS workflow mentioned below.

Be sure the links at the top of the index page in the root
directory are commented/uncommented appropriately.

If using a SCSS workflow or SASS compiler, this is not 
the right folder. Use the scss files in the scss directory
or this will happen:
  - main.css will be ignored
  - style.css will be overwritten
  - confusion and mayhem may ensue....
